The biggest outlier in this trend is the ninth inning, but that perhaps could be explained by (1).<br>Perhaps the increase in ejections per inning could be a factor of increasing tensions throughout the course of the game. With each inning that passes, the opportunities to make an impact dwindle while all participants might simultaneously start feeling more exhausted."
